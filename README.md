# what-i-learned-in-week-4
I honestly don't remember what was learned last week except for For Loops.
A for loop is a statement that repeats itself until it hits a false condition.
This is what a for statement looks like:
for ([initialExpression]; [condition]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

  This is a functioning for statement:

  for (let i = 1; i < 5; i ++) {
    console.log(i);
}

In the for statement I am basically saying; i is equal to 1; 1 is less than 5; and that i moves in increments of one.
